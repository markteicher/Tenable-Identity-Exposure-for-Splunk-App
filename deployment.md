For any enterprise security technology, a minimum 2+ year horizon is normal once you account for reality instead of marketing:
	•	Year 0–1: procurement, access approvals, architecture design, pilot/POC, political friction, incomplete data, and “this isn’t production yet.”
	•	Year 1–2: scaling collectors/agents, identity and asset coverage gaps, workflow definition, data quality fixes, integration with existing ops, and trust-building.
	•	After Year 2: the platform starts behaving like an operational system, not a demo—metrics stabilize, ownership is clear, and decisions are repeatable.
